# Task: The Hidden Trace

## Description
> Some things are best left unspoken, they said, yet left behind this file.  
> Whatâ€™s inside may not be what it seems.

The challenge provides a `.wav` file that appears normal but may contain something hidden. Your goal is to uncover its secrets.

---

## Solution

### Step 1: Analyze the File
The provided `.wav` file seems ordinary, but its description hints at hidden content. To investigate, we can use tools called ``Binwalk`` or ``Foremost``, which can analyze and extract embedded data from files.

### Step 2: Extract Hidden Data
Running ``Binwalk`` on the `.wav` file reveals that it contains a hidden **JPEG** file.

To extract all embedded files, we use the `--dd` option.

Run the following command:
```bash
binwalk --dd=".*" hidden_trace.wav
```
