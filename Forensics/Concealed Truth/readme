Can you bring its hidden contents to light?

---

## Solution

### Step 1: Analyze the File
The provided file is an image that looks normal at first glance. However, based on the challenge description, it likely contains hidden data embedded using steganography.

### Step 2: Extract data
Steghide is a common tool used for embedding data into files. To extract hidden content, we use StegSeek, a tool designed to brute-force passwords for Steghide-embedded files.

Run the following command:
![alt stegseek What_the_hell.jpg](./Stegseek.png)

Great! we got data.txt file : 
```VTJWamRYSnBibVYwYzN0VGRETm5hREZrWlY5WVgwSkFjMlUyTkY5UU1IY3pjaUY5```

Now we just need to decode that :
```echo "VTJWamRYSnBibVYwYzN0VGRETm5hREZrWlY5WVgwSkFjMlUyTkY5UU1IY3pjaUY5" | base64 -d | base64 -d```

Finally we got the flag :
```Securinets{St3gh1de_X_B@se64_P0w3r!}```
