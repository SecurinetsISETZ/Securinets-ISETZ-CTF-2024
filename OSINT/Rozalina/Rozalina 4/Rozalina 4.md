## **Solution**

This challenge ties together clues hidden in the **descriptions** of the other challenges. Intentional mistakes were embedded in each description, and the solution requires collecting and reordering these characters to form the final flag.<br><br>

### Step 1: Collecting the Characters<br>
Each challenge description contained specific characters meant to be pieced together:<br>
- **Rozalina 1**: `i n e t`<br>
- **Rozalina 2**: `1 g h d i s _ n`<br>
- **Rozalina 3**: `_ d d y 1`<br><br>

### Step 2: Understanding Rozalina 4's Clue<br>
The description for Rozalina 4 stated: **"in the same place."** This hinted that the final part of the flag is the word **"zaghouan"**.<br><br>

### Step 3: Reordering the Characters<br>
By reordering and combining all the collected characters with the clue from Rozalina 4, the final flag is constructed.<br><br>
Flag: **Securinets{teddy_1s_h1ding_in_zaghouan}**
