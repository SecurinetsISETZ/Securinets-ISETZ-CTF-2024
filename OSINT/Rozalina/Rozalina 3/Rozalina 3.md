## **Description**

a cryptic_message appears in the secure inbox:<br>

"she playedd his favorite game. Not his own, but one he always mentionedd. his friend’s cryptic game. the name's odd. Repeats twice, but not exactly the same. find it, and you’ll find her."<br>

the team exchanges glances. the repetition of the name feels deliberate. but who is this person?<br> the informant doesn’t give much awaY, but the name is clear—it’s sharbatak. that’s the starting point.<br> they know they need to find him, 1 but where to begin?<br>

## **Solution:**
When I want to search for people, I will immediatly think about looking up for their facebook accounts or any other social media ccounts they own. So, I searched for "sharbatak sharbatak" to find [his account](https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=61570813028573). I only found one post and it was indicating that "sharbatak" is also on X (twitter) so I looked for [Mr teddy freddy](https://x.com/MrTeddy12995139) as the post mentionned and found [a post](https://x.com/chris_comesthru/status/521057138849120256) in which a unicorn was tagged as well so I checked that unicorn's account to find a post and one of its comments mentionned the game. I searched cryptic unicorn and got [the game](https://www.cryptounicorns.fun/) name.
