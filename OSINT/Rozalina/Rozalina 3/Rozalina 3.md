## **Description**

a cryptic_message appears in the secure inbox:<br>

"she playedd his favorite game. Not his own, but one he always mentionedd. his friend’s cryptic game. the name's odd. Repeats twice, but not exactly the same. find it, and you’ll find her."<br>

the team exchanges glances. the repetition of the name feels deliberate. but who is this person?<br> the informant doesn’t give much awaY, but the name is clear—it’s sharbatak. that’s the starting point.<br> they know they need to find him, 1 but where to begin?<br>

## **Solution**

When searching for people, the first approach is often to look up their social media accounts, such as Facebook or other platforms.  
In this challenge, I started by searching for "sharbatak sharbatak" and discovered [his Facebook account](https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=61570813028573).  

### Step 1: Analyzing the Facebook Account  
The account had only one post, but it provided a valuable clue: **"sharbatak"** was also active on X (formerly Twitter).  

### Step 2: Searching on X  
Following the hint, I looked for the username **MrTeddyFreddy** and found [his profile on X](https://x.com/MrTeddy12995139).  
On this profile, I came across [a specific post](https://x.com/chris_comesthru/status/521057138849120256) where a unicorn was tagged.

### Step 3: Investigating the Tagged Unicorn  
I visited the unicorn's profile and explored its posts. One of the comments on a post referenced **a game**.  

### Step 4: Finding the Game  
Using the keyword **"cryptic unicorn"** from the comment, I conducted a search and discovered the name of the game:  
[Crypto Unicorns](https://www.cryptounicorns.fun/).<br>
