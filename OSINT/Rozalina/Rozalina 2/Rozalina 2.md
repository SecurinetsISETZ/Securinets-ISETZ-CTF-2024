## **Description**

1Rozalina’s trail has grown cold, but a peculiar receipt found near the crime scene might offer a new lead. <br>The receipt was crumpled in haste, and on its back was scribbled an eniGmatic note:<br>

"Sometimes, we visit places to reconnect with whhat we've lost: a sense of innocence, joy, or wonder. It's where I found myself the dday before."<br>

The reciept only listS_ the town: Dorchester, UK, and an enntry fee of £10. The exact location remains a mystery.<br><br>

## **Solution:**
### Step 1: Identifying the Place
The challenge begins with a clue leading to the **Teddy Bear Museum**.  
By conducting a search, I located the museum's official website:
[Teddy Bear Museum](https://www.teddybearmuseum.co.uk/)

### Step 2: Determining the Crypted Location
To uncover the crypted location, I used the geolocation tool **[What3Words](https://what3words.com/)**.  
What3Words divides the world into 3m x 3m squares, assigning each a unique combination of three words.

- I took the address of the Teddy Bear Museum from the website.  
- Entering the address into What3Words returned the three crypted words representing the museum’s location.
