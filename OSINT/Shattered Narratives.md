## **Solution**

### Step 1: Using WikiLeaks Advanced Search<br>
To begin, I navigated to [WikiLeaks](https://wikileaks.org/) and used its advanced search feature to narrow down articles related to **Palestine**.  
I included the specific phrase **"six women and 55 children"** in the search query. This led me to an article revealing the identity of a Palestinian individual.<br><br>

### Step 2: Finding Additional Information<br>
Using the individual's name, I conducted a search and found [this article](https://www.dci.plo.ps/en/article/22140/June-3,-2023---Middle-East-Monitor-Around-160-Palestine-prisoners-in-critical-condition-in-Israel-jails).  
In the article, the individual mentioned the name of a **martyr**.<br><br>

### Step 3: Researching the Martyr<br>
I searched for the martyr's name to uncover more details, including:<br>
- The **place of death**<br>
- The **nickname**<br><br>

### Step 4: Using Instagram for Further Details<br>
To find the **condolence date and time**, I searched the martyr's name on Instagram and found a support page under the handle **free_walid_daqqah**.  
This page had two followings, one of which was **asad_daka**.  

By examining posts on **asad_daka's** account, I found an Arabic post containing the needed information.<br><br>
