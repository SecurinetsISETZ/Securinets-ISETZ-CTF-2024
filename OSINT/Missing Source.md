## **Description**

While working on a university project, I came across an image of a car that caught my attention. It wasn’t just any photo — it’s part of a larger story, a video that shows the car’s journey to the port. I remember seeing the full video on a random website.

However, I can’t quite recall the exact page it was on, but I know it’s there, hidden somewhere within the labyrinth of the web. Can you track it down and identify the article linked to this image? <br>

The first search result leads to [this website](https://www.pond5.com/fr/stock-footage/item/157550942-tunis-tunisia-1960-car-goes-ferry-port) where I found two key pieces of information. The car was in Tunisia on its way to Palermo, Italy. As a result, we have two pieces of footage: one showing the car leaving Tunisia and another capturing its arrival at the port in Italy:<br>
